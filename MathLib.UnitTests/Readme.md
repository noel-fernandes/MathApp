# MathLib.UnitTests

### Description
A test project for the MathLib class library. 

The class library exposes a factorial function which calculates the factorial for a given number.

Factorial(n) -> n * (n-1) * ... * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

Factorial(0) -> 1

### Example 

Factorial of 3, mathematically denoted: 3!

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

### Features

1. Calculates factorial using recursive functions.
2. Calculates factorial using list functions.
3. The calculation method (recursive functions or list functions) is controlled using a global constant or constructor.
4. Calcuates factorial for odd numbers.
5. Calculates factorial for squared numbers.
6. The switch from feature #3 is also applicable to features 4 & 5.

### Technologies
Project is created with
* xUnit
* C#
* .NET 5.0
