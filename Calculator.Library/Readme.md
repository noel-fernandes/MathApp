# Calculator.Library

### Description
A Class library project for a calculator app. 

The library exposes a factorial function which calculates the factorial for a given number.

Factorial(n) -> n * (n-1) * ... * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

Factorial(0) -> 1

### Example 

Factorial of 3, mathematically denoted: 3!

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

### Features

1. Calculates factorial using recursive functions.
2. Calculates factorial using list functions.
3. The calculation method (recursive functions or list functions) is controlled using a global constant or constructor.
4. Calcuates factorial for odd numbers.

    Eg: 7! = 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 and 8! = 7 * 5 * 3 * 1

5. Calculates factorial for squared numbers.

    Eg: 4! = 4<sup>2</sup> * 3<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup> * 1<sup>2</sup>

6. The switch from feature #3 is also applicable to features 4 & 5.
